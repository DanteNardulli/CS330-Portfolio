# CS330-Portfolio
All of my files including my final were too big to add to my workspace so I added what I could.

How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  My new skills are a general understanding of how OpenGL works and how to add objects, lighting, texture, and so much more to a project.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I took a picture of some chess pieces on my chess board and recreated them.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  It can be applied in many ways depending on what I am working on. I know how to change lighting throughout scenes, change the size and orientation of objects. I can now add cameras and restrict their mobility. 

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  I did not deviate much from what was in the rubric as far as strategies as I did not want to complicate my code and make the scene do something unintentional.

How did iteration factor into your development?
  I had to iterate a loop for the chessboard to make each square opposite colored.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  The code throughout the milestones was able to be directly applied to my final project giving me a great understanding of what was needed and how to impliment it. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Understanding how graphics work in a 3d scene could benefit my future success in any class that may deal with 3D scenes or graphics in general.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  I am not sure if they will benefit my future professional path but I will definitely enjoy them in my future personal path!
